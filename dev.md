# Dev

## Installation

Your computer needs:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) \(0.12 or greater\)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Deal with your node versions

If you have some issues try to install **Node Version Manager,** a simple bash script to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

[https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

ðŸ’¡ **Protip:** Show the list of differents Node.js versions installed with `nvm list` and choose a default one with `nvm alias default 6.x.x`

### Installing npm packages

There are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want to use the package.

For now we are going to use the global installation like this one:

```bash
$ npm install github-email --global
```

ðŸ’¡ **Protip:** Search for packages on [GitHub](https://github.com/explore) or [npmsearch](https://npmsearch.com/)

_Challenge:_

* [ ] Try to find my email with `github-email`

## Mastering the Foundation CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```
$ npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a new Foundation website

```bash
$ foundation new
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

_Challenges:_

* [ ] Build your first foundation website with the CLI
* [ ] Choose _Handlebars templates and Sass/JS compilers_
* [ ] Launch your local server with `foundation watch`
* [ ] Commit your changes with theses commands
  * [ ] `$ git init`
  * [ ] `$ git add .`
  * [ ] `$ git commit --message 'Initial commit :new:'`

## Dependencies 101

Welcome in the new JavaScript dependencies ~~world,~~ jungle ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´
First everything is gonna be alright, just take a breath and read theses sentences.

> **Npm** is a package manager for Node.js
> **Bower** is a JavaScript package manager ðŸ’€
> **Yarn** is a package manager for your code ðŸššâœ¨

Remember just one thing every dependencies lives in `package.json` or `bower.json`

For example if you want the same layout as medium.com you can install the [headroom.js](http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) library

###### Install with npm

```
$ npm install headroom.js --save
```

###### Install with bower

```
$ bower install https://unpkg.com/headroom.js/bower.zip --save
```

###### Install with yarn

```
$ yarn add headroom.js --save
```

ðŸš“ Never omit `--save`option because it update automatically the dependecy file. Remember you work in a team. If you install a local dependency without saving it, you are going to break the project for others.
