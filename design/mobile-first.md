## Mobile first approach

A little Explanation of the mobile first, always start by the `.small-*` CSS class when you are coding the page.

`<div class="row">  
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 colunms"></div>  
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 colunms"></div>  
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 colunms"></div>  
</div>`

**Protip:** There are 2 grid system in foundation. For the begining [use the classic one](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html) to get support for the largest number of old devices.

_Challenges:_

* [ ] Use the grid with `.callout`classes to reproduce the **Scale picure**
