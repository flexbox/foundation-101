# Flex Grid

## Getting Started

Learn how to quickly build complex responsive layouts using the Foundation Flex Grid.

**foundation-flex-grid file**

First you need to include `foundation-flex-grid` in your project `<PROJECT_NAME>/src/assets/scss/app.scss`

~~~sass
// @include foundation-grid;
@include foundation-flex-grid;
â€¦
// @include foundation-float-classes;
@include foundation-flex-classes;
~~~

**flexbox variable**

Activate the flexbox grid system on your settings  `<PROJECT_NAME>/src/assets/scss/_settings.scss`

~~~sass
$global-flexbox: true;
~~~

ðŸš¨ Now [refferal to the Flex Grid documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html) for building your layout.

_Challenge:_

* [ ] Activate the flexbox grid

## [Block grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html#block-grids)

Create evenly spaced blocks and get elements to line up easily. You can **define column widths at the row-level**, instead of the individual column level.

~~~html
<div class="row small-up-1 medium-up-2 large-up-3">
  <div class="column">1 per row on small</div>
  <div class="column">2 per row on medium</div>
  <div class="column">3 per row on large</div>
</div>
~~~

### Real life example

Letâ€™s build our first video games list!![](/assets/zelda-games.png)For this we need some datas in json file `<PROJECT_NAME>/src/data/games.json`

~~~json
[
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda",
    "support": "Nes"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past",
    "support": "Super Nes"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time",
    "support": "Nintendo 64"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask",
    "support": "Nintendo 64"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker",
    "support": "Nintendo GameCube"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess",
    "support": "Nintendo GameCube"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword",
    "support": "Wii"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild",
    "support": "Nintendo Switch"
  }
]
~~~

~~~html
<div class="row small-up-1 medium-up-2 large-up-3">
  {{#each games}}
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="callout">
        <span class="label">{{this.support}}</span>
        <p>
          <strong>{{this.name}}</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>
~~~

**Protip:**
{{#each user in users 5}} 
    {{user.name}}
{{/each}}

_Challenge:_

* [ ] Add The Legend of Zelda games on your `index.html`

## [Source Ordering](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html#source-ordering)

Shift columns around between our breakpoints to dictate how responsive layouts are viewed.

~~~html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column small-order-2 medium-order-1">
    This column will come second on small, and first on medium and larger.
  </div>
  <div class="column small-order-1 medium-order-2">
    This column will come first on small, and second on medium and larger.
  </div>
</div>
